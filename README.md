# My Undergrad Thesis

Code and my undegrad thesis (2015). In this thesis, I propose a different
approach to dictionary learning called "non-sparse dictionary learning".
My experiments show that my approach is faster, better than other sparse dictionary learning approaches.

Although people don't use dictionary learning any more today, I just want to publish
here for reference purpose and it's fun to look back.
